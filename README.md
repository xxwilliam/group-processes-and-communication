<p><b>Group processes and communication</b></p>

<p>We have been in constant contact with each other through Microsoft teams, using the message function and video link on a regular basis, meetings are 2 to 3 times per week and go for about 30 mins to an hour. We have had a few hick-ups with Alex’s computer going down for a week, then unforeseen personal circumstances for all members of our group. However, we have stayed in constant contact via message on Teams as it has been the best tool for us within this challenging time. We have been able to check up on each other, offer support, delegate tasks and update on where we are all up to. The Teams message tool has really offered an equal source of communication as a video link would have and hasn’t failed us in being able to complete our project.</p>
